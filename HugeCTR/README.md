### 500 Iterations Test
This test aims to show the training loss convergency profile and validation area under the ROC Curve(AUC) during 500 steps testing. 

To show the tendency of the loss and AUC curves clearly, the total training batch size is set to 512 which is a small value compared to the WDL industry production scenario. Validation should be performed every training step.

### 300,000 Iterations Test
This test aims to show the training loss profile and validation area under the ROC Curve(AUC) during 300,000 steps testing. Compare to 500 iters test, we print loss and AUC every 1000 steps, it will bring us a long period view of loss and AUC curves.

### Fixed Total Batch Size Test
This test will keep the total batch size as a constant value(default is 16384), each test case adopts a different number of GPU devices, such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

Latency and GPU device memory usage should be recorded in this test.

### Fixed Batch Size per Device Test
This test will keep batch size per device as a constant value(default is 16384), each test case adopts a different number of GPU devices, such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, the total batch size is scaled up with the total number of devices.

Latency and GPU device memory usage should be recorded in this test.

### Batch Size Double Test
This test uses one GPU device, batch size of the first case is 512 while the subsequent cases are doubled, and so on. This test can be performed on single device, single node and multi-nodes.

Latency and GPU device memory usage should be recorded in this test.

### Vocabulary Size Double Test
This test will use devices as much as possible, vocabulary size of the first case is 3,200,000 while the subsequent cases are doubled, and so on. This test can be performed on single device, single node and multi-nodes.

Latency and GPU device memory usage should be recorded in this test.

## Test Results

If test with multiple devices, only the log of device 0 is recorded.

### batch size X 2 tests
All batch size double tests were performed with 2 x 1024 Hidden Fully-connected Units.
